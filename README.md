#### Why Oh My Cal! ?
You may want to ask: *The Calculator.app in OS X is powerful, why should I use the Oh My Cal! ?*

The Calculator.app in OS X is powerful, but it's not convenient. For me, I usually use many apps in fullscreen mode( Xcode, Evernote, etc.). Whenever I want to calculate some formulas, I have to switch among several apps or screens. Oh, I really could not stand!!! So I wrote Oh My Cal!. In addition to as powerful as the Calculator.app in OS X, it's very convenient to use (Global Callout or Hanging in menu bar).

#### What's New in This Version (v2.0.3)?

* Stability improved.
* Killed some fucking bugs:
    * Lagging when switch OCT/DEC/HEX mode.
    *  The Enter, Clear and Equal button on the "Apple Keyboard With Numeric Keypad" all do not work. ( found by Mr. Tobias Kroniger ).
* Support of Pasteboard.
* Supports of Parentheses and more will coming soon!
* Various minor improvements.
* Enjoy & STAY TUNED!
